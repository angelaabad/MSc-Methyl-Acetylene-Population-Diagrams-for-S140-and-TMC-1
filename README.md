## Abstract
**Aims.** To deduce the kinetic temperature of the cold and dense molecular clouds S140 and TMC-1, as well as the total column density of their methyl acetylene molecule utilizing radio analysis conducted at the Onsala Space Observatory.

**Methods.** Spectral emission lines of the K-multiplet from the rotational transition J = 6 → 5 are detected, under the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE), through the use of a data reduction software (XS). Through this analysis, population diagrams can be generated, allowing us to estimate the desired parameters.

**Results.** S140 temperature estimate lies in the interval $`T_{S140} = (34.72 ± 2.75) K`$ and its molecular column density ranges in $`N_{S140} = (2.83 ± 0.38) · 10^{14} cm^{−2}`$; whereas for TMC-1 we arrived to $`T_{TMC−1} = (36.98 ± 12.43) K`$ and $`N_{TMC−1} = (1.15 ± 0.62) · 10^{14} cm^{−2}`$. 

**Conclusions.** Although the population diagram can be considered a highly effective tool for deducing physical conditions within dense clouds when applied to accurately collected and integrated data, as in the case of S140, it can lead to less reliable results when applied to poorly obtained signals, failing to provide meaningful insights, as occured with TMC-1. Nevertheless, these results could provide valuable guidance for future studies, giving background comparison in an attempt to perfection the observation mechanism and giving a new perspective into the study of star-forming regions.
